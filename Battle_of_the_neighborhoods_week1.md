# The Battle of the Neighborhoods - Week 1
## 1. A discription of the business problem and a discussion of the backround
### a. Backround
Hamburg is the second largest city after Berlin and is located in the North of Germany. Hamburg's port is the Europe's third largest. Furthermore, the economy consists of banking, finance, media and legal advices, industrial production, the lately built Hafencity and a continually growing tourist market. Many different cultures live in the city and opened restaurants for the inhabitants and for the tourists. There is a high diversity of different places to eat, such as Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Jewish, Syrian, Italian, French, Belgian, German, Turkish, Pakistani, U.S.-American, English, Brasilian, Cuban, Spanish, Hispanic and even more. The client now wants to open a burger joint in Hamburg, that should be placed near Hafencity. Since 2016, the Elbphilharmonie (nickname "Elphi"), an amazing concert hall is eventually finished and attracts many tourists in Hamburg's still changing new built Hafencity.

### b. Business problem
The business problem is about a client who wants to open a Burger joint in Hamburg. As there are already some established single places and also burger chains in the city, it it especially important to find a location, where the competition is not too high. On the other hand, enough tourists and inhabitants should consider to go to the place. That's why it should be easily reachable by public service and by pedestriants and maybe even be located near sightseeing spots. These requirements are met especially near the city center and near the Hafencity, because most tourists go there first. The burger joint should also have special USPs (unique selling points)to strengthen its position in the market. A lot of people do not want to buy meat of mass husbandry any more, but emphasize organic food. A growing tendency of customers demanding vegan and vegetarian patties is being observed as well. A market analysis has shown that a higher quality of the ingredients combined with a higher selling price is a profitable strategy in the burger segment. Fewer people go to the classic fast food burger chains such as Mc Donald's or Burger King, but customers experience an increasing need for a luxurious Burger event that interferes a certain amount of coziness during the meal. 
## 2. A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem
Based on the criteria thatt we consider important, factors that will influence our decisions are:

Number of existing burger joints in the neighborhood and type of restaurants
Distance of neighborhood from city center and Hafencity

A further data exploration will be necessary and should rely on the following data sources:

number of existing burger joints and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API
The coordinates of Hamburg center will be obtained using Nominatim geocoding of well known Hamburg location (Rathaus (Townhall) and the Hafencity).
